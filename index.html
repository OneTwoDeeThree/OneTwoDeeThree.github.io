        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a firm believer that sports are the greatest form of storytelling that exists on Earth. Sports can be painfully sad and tragic, as well as unbelievably joyous and euphoric. They can make you angry, and make you vulnerable. They can awe-inspire and bore, elate and depress, and so many other feelings and emotions. They are all possible through sports. I have known this for some time now, and it is my responsibility to convey these feelings through the videos and productions I make. My goal is for others to see just how emotional sports of all kinds are, whether it be baseball, football, soccer, motorsport, and more, and how they can inspire, enrage, deject, and elate anyone who consumes the stories within these sports. I have seen it first hand, really, as I have been involved in sports fandom since a very early age, and it only continues to intensify as I get older. As time goes on, I feel myself becoming more passionate about the ways that sports can tell a story, as I have experienced more and more occurrences of this phenomenon happening. It was around high school when I realized I had an outlet to express these feelings and potentially show others what I came to realize over time about sports.<br><br>

        I started taking a video production class in high school, and since then, I have produced docu-style sports videos as well as music videos and sound design showcases. I have written, recorded, and edited these videos mainly by myself, with knowledge of storyboarding, scriptwriting, editing using Premiere Pro, and recording voice lines in a professional setting. I have collaborated with others on some of these projects, but for the most part, I prefer to go through these processes by myself. I have a passion for this production process, and I am constantly looking for ways to improve my abilities. To be able to have a creative outlet where I can be independent and free to express any story I desire is very important to me, and I feel contributes most to my abilities as a storyteller. If I can show someone who otherwise would never have thought sports to contain such incredible stories, that they in fact do, then I consider myself accomplished and happy. 
<br><br>

        I am very grateful to anyone who has read to this point, and I hope you can share some of my sentiments regarding the storytelling abilities of sports. If not, then I hope some of my content will be able to. I hope you will consider my portfolio in the same way that I consider your time to be valuable, and I look forward to hearing from anyone interested in knowing more about my processes. Thank you.
